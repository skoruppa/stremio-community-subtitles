# 🛡️ Privacy Policy – Stremio Community Subtitles

_Last updated: January 26, 2026_

This addon was built to improve subtitle support for all Stremio users while respecting your privacy. Here's exactly what data we collect and how we use it.

---

## 🔐 What We Collect and Why

When you use the addon, we store a minimal amount of data necessary to provide its core features:

- **Account Info**
  - Your email and username (required to log in).
  - Timestamps of when your account was created and when you last logged in.

- **Viewing History**
  - If you have the addon installed in Stremio, we store the **5 most recent items** you've watched, to help you upload subtitles faster.
  - Older entries are automatically removed. You can also manually delete your history at any time.

- **Uploaded Subtitles**
  - Subtitles you upload are stored on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), and they're publicly accessible to other users of the addon.
  - You remain the owner of the files you upload and can delete them anytime from the website.

- **Votes on Subtitles**
  - If you upvote or downvote a subtitle, that vote is stored to help others find the best-matched subtitles.

- **Subtitle Provider Credentials**
  - If you connect external subtitle providers (OpenSubtitles, SubDL, Subsource), we store your **API keys or access tokens** only. We never store your provider passwords.

- **Cookies**
  - A single session cookie (`hear`) is used to keep you logged in between visits. No tracking cookies are used.

## 📁 How Your Data Is Used

We only use the collected data to:

- Let you log in and sync subtitles across devices.
- Automatically match subtitles to what you're watching.
- Improve the quality of subtitle recommendations for everyone.
- Allow you to manage your uploaded subtitles and history.
- Connect to external subtitle providers on your behalf.

We **do not** use your data for analytics, tracking, advertising, or any commercial purposes.

- **SubDL** – Used to fetch subtitles using your API key (if connected).

We do not share any personal data with these services beyond what's technically required.

This addon is community-driven. We aim to store only what's strictly necessary to make it work – and nothing more.
