# 🛡️ Privacy Policy – Stremio Community Subtitles

_Last updated: June 3, 2025_

This addon was built to improve subtitle support for all Stremio users while respecting your privacy. Here's exactly what data we collect and how we use it.

---

## 🔐 What We Collect and Why

When you use the addon, we store a minimal amount of data necessary to provide its core features:

- **Account Info**
  - Your email and username (required to log in).
  - Timestamps of when your account was created and when you last logged in.

- **Viewing History**
  - If you have the addon installed in Stremio, we store the **5 most recent items** you've watched, to help you upload subtitles faster.
  - Older entries are automatically removed. You can also manually delete your history at any time.

- **Uploaded Subtitles**
  - Subtitles you upload are stored on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), and they’re publicly accessible to other users of the addon.
  - You remain the owner of the files you upload and can delete them anytime from the website.

- **Votes on Subtitles**
  - If you upvote or downvote a subtitle, that vote is stored to help others find the best-matched subtitles.

- **OpenSubtitles Token**
  - If you log in to OpenSubtitles, we store your **access token** only. We never store your OpenSubtitles username or password.

- **Cookies**
  - A single session cookie (`hear`) is used to keep you logged in between visits. No tracking cookies are used.

## 📁 How Your Data Is Used

We only use the collected data to:

- Let you log in and sync subtitles across devices.
- Automatically match subtitles to what you're watching.
- Improve the quality of subtitle recommendations for everyone.
- Allow you to manage your uploaded subtitles and history.

We **do not** use your data for analytics, tracking, advertising, or any commercial purposes.

## 🔗 Third-Party Services

- **Cloudinary** – Used to store uploaded subtitle files.
- **OpenSubtitles** – Used to fetch subtitles if no local match is found. API calls are made using your token (if connected).

We do not share any personal data with these services beyond what's technically required.

## ❌ No Tracking

We do **not** use cookies for analytics or advertising.  
No trackers. No profiling.

## 🧹 Data Control

- You can delete your uploaded subtitles and viewing history from the website.
- If you'd like to delete your account and all associated data, please contact us directly.

This addon is community-driven. We aim to store only what's strictly necessary to make it work – and nothing more.
